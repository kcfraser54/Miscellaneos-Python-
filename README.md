# hw2.py
This program processes time from an input file.  

# hw3.py
Performs the mark-sweep garbage collection algorithm after processing a file which contains mappings of variables which reference heap block fron 0 to n-1 and mappings of heap blocks 
to other heap blocks. The first line in the file gives the number of heap blocks and the rest of the lines in the file give a single ordered pair to represent a mapping.   
    
Creates and returns a dictionary specifying marked heap blocks and swept heap blocks. 
Assumptions:
Named pointers are referred to using variable names such as p, stackptr and temp3. 
Heap blocks are referred to using integers. 
Input is valid and properly formatted. There are not spaces in an input file line. 
A variable name consists of letters, digits, and underscores but cannot begin with a digit.
Variable names are unique.
There is at least 1 heap block.
